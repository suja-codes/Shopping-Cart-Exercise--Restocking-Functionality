### Description 

- This exercise shows how to build a restocking functionality by integrating Strapi with a React application.
- It is accomplished by making a call to a Strapi API and getting a fresh list of available products.

Here’s how the reset stock feature works:

- There’s an input field on the page that contains the URL to the Strapi back end.
- When a user clicks the “ReStock Products” button, a call is made to the Strapi back end specified in the input field.
- The result of this call is an updated list of products.

### To run this program

Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine to create your own application.

### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by adding more functionalities like tracking stock in cart and adding checkout functionality.
